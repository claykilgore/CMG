This is created by Larry Geller to document the versions of the Drupal and
CiviCRM software.  It is updated whenever either of these versions is upgraded.
6/15/18   Drupal is at 7.59 security patch level
          CiviCRM is at 5.2.1 which is still same as 4.x.x
Only these two pieces of software reside in /var/www/thecmg.info
(Currently staging.thecmg.info and test.thecmg.info are not used)
Staging can be used for testing and those instructions are in GR doc that I
have online as written by Peter Haight from Giant Rabbit.
